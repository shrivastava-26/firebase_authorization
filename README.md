## Introduction

Firebase Authentication provides backend services for easy use of authentication, including social login providers like Google, Facebook, and email/password authentication. This project showcases how to set up and use Firebase Authentication in a web application.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up Firebase Authentication in your project.

### Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Create a new project directory and run the following command to initialize it:


    mkdir firebase-auth-demo
    cd firebase-auth-demo
    npm init -y
    Then, install the Firebase SDK:
    
    
    npm install firebase
    Firebase Setup
    Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.
Click on "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new Firebase project.
Enable Authentication:

In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Authentication" section.
Click on "Get Started".
Enable the sign-in methods you want (Email/Password, Google, etc.).
Get Firebase Config:

Click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings".
Under "Your apps", register your app and copy the Firebase configuration object.
Add Firebase to Your Project:

Create a firebase.js file in your project directory and initialize Firebase:
// firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

        const firebaseConfig = {
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
            authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
            projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
            messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
            appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };
        
        const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
        export const auth = getAuth(app);
